Welcome to my minecraft admin tools.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Today I have only one tool - Minecraft Server GUI. It isn't done yet, but I'm doing my best :)

So, to use it you need to download all this source and compile it with your Visual Studio 2013. Then you should
put compiled *.exe to your minecraft server folder. After running app you should go to settings and find your
java.exe. That's all, feel free to use)))

After I complete core features I'll upload compiled binary.
